## About The Project

### Inspiration
We are a group of avid travelers. When traveling, we not only just want to plan our trip routes, but also explore new places and keep track of where we have visited in the past. Often, our friends ask us for travel ideas and we can easily show them our recommendations by pulling out our data in our website.

### What it does
Our project provides a solution for users who love to travel, or explore new places. The app takes in user's input of locations, and calculates the routes of the locations. In addition, the user can search for nearby businesses, such as restaurants, bars, hotelsâ€¦etc, and the user can also add those dropped locations into the map to form routes. The user can also remove any places from the route any time they want. They can also check history of routes they have been to through their personal account.
